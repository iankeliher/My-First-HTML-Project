		<h2 style="font-family: helvetica">Currently, I am excited for...</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Bleeding Edge</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>However...</h4></li>
						<li>I am worried that I might not have time this semester to read it, though.</li>
						<li>I was sort of underwhelmed by <a href="http://inherent-vice.pynchonwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Inherent Vice</a>. Really wasn't super-engaged by the Lemuria tangents.
						And wasn't there a Gilligan's Island-themed restaurant. Wasn't something like that in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/16/reviews/wallace-r-broom.html">The Broom of the System</a>?
						Maybe I should reread it...</li>
						<li>I don't know if I should spend the money on a hardback. I like eating.</li> 
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>COMMUNITY on NBC</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>Hooray!</h4>
						<li><a href="http://danharmon.tumblr.com/">Dan Harmon</a> is back!</li>
						<li>So is Chris McKenna!</li>
						<li><h4>But sad because...</h4></li>
						<li><a href="https://twitter.com/meganganz">Megan Ganz</a> is no longer writing for the show. Though I probably couldn't pick one of her episodes out of a line up.
						Except for the Bottle Episode. But still sad.</li>
						<li>Apparently Donald Glover won't really be there...</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Inherent Vice</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I would trust him with a Pynchon adaptation.</li>
						<li>I think it's shot on the same type of stock and with the same aspect-ratio of The Master</li>
